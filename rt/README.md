`naga-rust-rt`: runtime support for executing shaders as Rust
=============================================================

This library provides types and functions which are used by the Rust code generated by
[`naga-rust-back`] or [`naga-rust-embed`]. These types and functions implement vector arithmetic
in the style expected by shader code, which differs from straightforward Rust in various ways.

This library currently does not have a clean public API distinct from the API provided
for the benefit of the code generator. Expect changes in future versions.
